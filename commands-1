# kill        **The kill command can kill a process, given its process ID. You can get this information from the ps -A, top or pgrep commands.

# kill PID

# pgrep       **Given a search term, pgrep returns the process IDs that match it. For example, you could use the following command to find Firefox’s PID:
# pgrep firefox
# kill $(pgrep firefox)

# pkill
# killall

# renice        ** to set priority: -19 very high ; 19 very low ; 0 default 
# renice 19 PID
**If you’re making a process run at a higher priority, you’ll require root permissions. On Ubuntu, use sudo for that:
# sudo renice -19 PID

# xkill
